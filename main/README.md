SKILL EXCHANGE HUB

The Hyperlocal Skill Exchange Hub is a crossplatform mobile application designed to foster real-time skill
sharing within local communities, addressing challenges such as
limited access to local expertise, lack of community engagement,
and inefficient skill discovery. Built using Flutter for seamless
Android and iOS compatibility and powered by Firebase for
authentication, real-time database, and Firestore, the platform
offers an integrated suite of features: secure user onboarding,
real-time skill listings, personalized profile management, skill
offer management (up to three skills per user), and secure oneto-one real-time chat for collaboration. Developed through an
agile methodology with rigorous testing, the app ensures a userfriendly experience with minimal latency across devices.
